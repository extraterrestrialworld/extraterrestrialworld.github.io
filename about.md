# A Small Note on the Methods That Will Be Used

This blog is intended to discuss specific policies and strategies for a socialist party, particularly in the USA, but in general should be applicable in most places.  I will be borrowing heavily from a few different sources namely [Programming Class Struggle and Social Revolution](http://www.reality.gn.apc.org/polemic/richter1.pdf) written under the pseudonym of J. Richter, and Paul Cockshott's work on transition to socialism mostly from [Transitions to 21st Century Socialism in the European Union](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:EfgpJ7iR3ekJ:reality.gn.apc.org/econ/Berlinpaper.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), and videos on transition from his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVBfIU1_zO-P_R9keEGdDHQ).  

The traditional social democratic program, or Erfurtian program, is split into three sections. First an analysis of present day society and its development. Second, the objects of the Social Democracy. And third, the means which are to lead to the realization of these objects (in the words of Kautsky).  While this minimum maximum program structure has the advantage of a clear and succinct method that is easily understood, in practice it can lead to confusion.  It tends to be static, with minimums and maximums differing between the interpreter.  A more dynamic method is needed with clearer types of demands.  The main three we will use are "maximalist demands, transformative demands, and lesser demands that are nevertheless structural, oppositionist, and directional to varying degrees".  These lesser demands should always be oppositionist, not relying on coalitions with bourgeois parties.  

I will introduce two concepts from Programming Class Struggle, the Hahnel criterion and the Kaustky criterion, which I will continuously refer to.  The Hahnel criterion says a demand should be one *"which in its entirety facilitates the issuance of either intermediate or threshold demands later on"*, while the Kautsky criterion says it should *"simultaneously enable the basic principles to be "kept consciously in view""*.  These tests should be in mind when formulating lesser demands.  

Transformative demands are "those that would require a very directional break from capitalism".  An example being "full and comprehensible transparency in all governmental, commercial, and other related affairs (not just the abolition of "business secrets")".  Maximalist demands would be those that would necessitate a full break from capitalism and fully change the relations of production towards a socialist economy.  

This is only a small overview of the dynamic method enumerated in Programming Class Struggle, and a skimming of the work may help you to further understand it.  These articles are meant to generate discussion and should not be taken as a static approach to generating a program.
